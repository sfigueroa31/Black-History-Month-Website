<h1 class="title">Dr. Rediet Abebe</h1>
<br>
<h3 class="title">Biography</h3>
<p class="title">Dr. Rediet Abebe is a computer scientist working in algorithms and artificial intelligence. She is an assistant professor of computer science at Berkeley. She holds a PhD in computer science from Cornell university. Her research focuses on examining questions related to inequality and distributive justice. 
    Her work includes algorithmic frameworks for examining issues in underserved communities. She created a project “Algorithms on Trial: Interrogating Evidentiary Statistical Software” she hopes it will shed light on the improper use of software tools as evidence in the U.S. criminal legal system and will demonstrate how the way inputs to artificial technology are chosen have huge implications for social justice and discrimination.
